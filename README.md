# Linux kernel and /sbin/init only system

== Whats this? ==

This is a minimal example, how can running system with only a Linux kernel and single ELF binary.

== Why? ==

* This use a minimal resources. It can running only 45 MB RAM.
* You can create a secure architecture, because of the single /sbin/init capable system. So in this system can't execute reverse shell, etc., because it does't contains any binaries and the system is readonly.

For example:
